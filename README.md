## Abstract

This presentation will discuss the implementation of an image-based identification system for wine labels using Python scientific and machine learning libraries. An overview of the methodology for this technique, called content-based image retrieval, will be presented. Techniques for improving search accuracy and retrieval time will also be discussed. The intended audience is individuals who have a limited/basic familiarity with machine learning and computer vision techniques.
